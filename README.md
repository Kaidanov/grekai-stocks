![Grekai Stocks Dashboard](docs/dashboard.png)

## Features

- Real-time stock price tracking with WebSocket support
- Interactive candlestick and line charts
- Toggle between real and mock data sources
- Responsive design with horizontal/vertical layouts
- Support for major tech stocks (NVDA, MSFT, TSLA, etc.)

## Key Components

### DataSwitch
The DataSwitch component allows toggling between real and mock data sources:


typescript
import { Switch } from '@/components/ui/switch'
import styles from './DataSwitch.module.css'
export const DataSwitch = () => {
return (
<div className={styles.container}>
<Switch defaultChecked />
<span>Use Real Data</span>
</div>
)
}
## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14+
- TypeScript 5
- Syncfusion Components
- CSS Modules
- Real-time Stock Data API

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grekai-stocks.git

2. Install dependencies:
bash
npm install

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your API keys:
For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module './DataSwitch.module.css' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error persists because Next.js needs to be configured to handle CSS Modules. Let's update the Next.js config:
After making this change, try:
Delete the .next folder
Run npm run dev again
If you're still getting the error, make sure you have sass installed:
didn't work. try to fix

Let's try a different approach. In Next.js, CSS Modules are supported by default without extra configuration. Let's simplify:
First, revert next.config.js:
Rename your CSS file to follow the exact Next.js CSS Module naming convention:
Update the import in DataSwitch.tsx:
Install SASS:
Clean and rebuild:
This should resolve the module not found error. Let me know if you still encounter issues!
make the neu show 30 pixels lower

I'll modify the CSS to move the menu 30 pixels lower. Let's update the CSS module file:
This will add a 30px margin to the top of the switch container, moving it down by that amount.

when it appears above .. I want always to see menu 

Let's add a higher z-index to the menu to ensure it stays on top of the Syncfusion license banner. Update the CSS:
This will ensure the menu stays visible above the Syncfusion license banner by giving it a higher z-index value.

in the github make the repositories show gists

To create GitHub Gists for your key files, I'll help you create them. Here's how to add links to the Gists in your README:
To create the Gists:
Go to https://gist.github.com/
Create separate gists for each key file
Replace [gist_id_X] in the README with actual Gist IDs
Would you like me to help you create the specific Gist content for each file?
redo the readme and gists and enabel me to commit both with this is the image to add @https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/164266/395123487-95763236-9930-41f0-815a-7d8b0ea13623.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzQwMDEzMTYsIm5iZiI6MTczNDAwMTAxNiwicGF0aCI6Ii8xNjQyNjYvMzk1MTIzNDg3LTk1NzYzMjM2LTk5MzAtNDFmMC04MTVhLTdkOGIwZWExMzYyMy5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQxMjEyJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MTIxMlQxMDU2NTZaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT0yMTQxM2ViZjhkNzc0NjU4YzY1OWI0MzA5NWNiMmM0Y2YzMzZlODkzMTk4OGVkZTEzOGRhYTllNWE5N2Q3MGNiJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.R3w_GyueIb6aUdB63IShPCBb7d1jirH3SONQSxjsKXk 

I'll help you create a new README.md and prepare the gists for the DataSwitch component. Here's what I suggest:
typescript
import { Switch } from '@/components/ui/switch'
import styles from './DataSwitch.module.css'
export const DataSwitch = () => {
return (
<div className={styles.container}>
<Switch defaultChecked />
<span>Use Real Data</span>
</div>
)
}
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grekai-stocks.git
bash
npm install
STOCK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
